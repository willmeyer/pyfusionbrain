# PyFusionBrain

A Python interface to the [FusionBrain](http://www.mp3car.com/fusion-brain/) multi-function I/O device.

The FusionBrain supports several analog and digital inputs and outputs and is handy in all types of
automation and robotics projects. Read more about it in [the manual](https://github.com/willmeyer/pyfusionbrain/blob/master/docs/Fusion%20Brain.doc).

## Requirements & Setup

- A FusionBrain (V3) device connected via USB
- A machine that can run (the excellent) [PyUSB library](https://github.com/walac/pyusb)
- I've tested on MacOS with libusb, set up like so:
`brew install libusb`
`pip install pyusb`

## Using the Library

See the code, the interface is trivially simple.
